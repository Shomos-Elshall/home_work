Question:Describe the difference between var, dynamic, and explicitly typed variables in Dart

Answer: 
 var => var is a keyword that replaces the data type,
 determining the data type of the variable based on the value stored in it.

 ex. => var x = 12 ;  // x is a variable of type int, cant assign value of another data type to it
        x = "shomos"  // gives an error.

 dynamic => is a data type used when  we cant determine the type of data being store,
 we can assign values of any type to it.

 ex. => dynamic x  = "hello" ;
        x = 12;
        x = true;
